You hate writing it. And reading it.

Our goal (our only goal) is to help developers get on track with
documentation.

We have ideas on:

  * What you need to say
  * And where
  * And how much -- from Minimum Viable Documentation up to Unabridged
  * How to get help
  * surely more bullets..

Seeing is believing, so we include an annotated example of what we'd call a
good doc job, which you can compare to how it was originally written.


Why this site

???? teams asked for help when Google first offered to pair open-source
projects with technical writers. [footnote: 2019 Season of Docs; many of us
participated. Google is doing it again in 2020 <link>.] Though great work got
done, we recalled the proverb about giving a person a fish versus teaching
them fishing. [footnote: Typically quoted as: "Give a man a fish, and you feed
him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."]. We
resolved to build this site to help developers help themselves. A team may not
have the time to write everything -- Seasons of Docs are a great idea -- but
they will understand their documentation needs, and the docs they do have will
be sound.

If you've got nothing

If you're at square one, think last about process and first about setting down
the words. If you do have documentation tooling and can stand to use it, fine.
Otherwise, open a text editor and bang out what you know. You, or someone less
knowledgeable than you about the project, can fancify it later.

Four things called documentation

Divide-and-conquer applies also to docs. Documentation has four goals,
reulting in four kinds of
documentation with four goals and four writing approaches: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation.

This is the stunning insight of Daniele Procida: https://documentation.divio.com/.
Attacking each kind with the right focus and perspective makes the job easier. (And your docs will be
better organized, and readers will have an easier time finding what they need.)

3. If you're not a name-brand project, overwhelmingly your visitors have clicked a link
in Stack Overflow or Hacker News or a search engine and are window shopping. Think back to when you've done exactly
that, and whether you chose to read further.

And then
